    "The prevalence of obesity is a growing concern across the US. In 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 30% of adults over the age of 18 were obese. And, with more than two-thirds of Americans classified as overweight, the national obesity rate will only continue to grow.\n",

    "Obesity is a medical condition in which an individual carries excess weight or body fat resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above. It is linked to an increased risk for a variety of serious health conditions including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease. The obesity epidemic has wide-ranging ramifications, affecting not only individuals' wellbeing but also burdening society with added medical costs and decreased productivity. Research indicates that the total annual economic impact is in excess of $215 billion. \n",

    "Factors such as sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, known to be linked to obesity, can be impacted by environmental stimuli such as easy access to fast food rather than healthier options. In this study, we examine the link between obesity and city composition by leveraging Foursquare location data. The goal is to identify trends that differentiate America's most and least obese cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research would be of particular interest to policy makers looking to implement strategies to promote health and combat rising costs. A link between obesity and city composition would enable states to identify and actively monitor areas that may seed unhealthy lifestyle choices and address problems by encouraging development of alternative options, for example gyms, walking paths and affordable grocery stores.\n",
